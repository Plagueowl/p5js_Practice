This repository will contain all the animation and simulation logic which I will explore in this phase.

I am also practicing to write cleaner code. I will try my best to comment all my codes properly and keep things as simple and straightforward as possible.

This is something I am learning while working as a technical analyst at ReliaQuest. My manager (Nicholas Hurley) tells me to Document and build my work in such a way that if anybody on some random day explores my work, he/she should be able to understand it without getting confused.
